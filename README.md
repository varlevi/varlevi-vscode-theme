# varlevi-vscode-theme
Hi! This is my personal VS Code Theme, based on the Material Design Dark Theme. 
To install, just download this directory and put it in your computer's ```~/.vscode/extensions``` directory if on MacOS/Linux or ```%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions``` directory if on Windows. 
Enjoy!
